## ** Introduction **
This project is made collaborating with a friend. Adventure of Neverland is a Java GUI 2D shooting game with a twist... When you don't move, nothing moves, including time and projectiles; when you move, time moves again. This game utilizes free sprites that we found on the internet and customized so we have the right sprite size for our project.
