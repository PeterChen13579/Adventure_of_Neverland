# Adventure_of_Neverland
This project is made collaborating with a friend. Adventure of Neverland is a Java GUI 2D shooting game with a twist.... if you stop moving nothing moves including time and projectiles; when you move, time moves again. We used free sprites found online and customized it so it fits in our game.
